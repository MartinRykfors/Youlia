# Keys

<kbd>space</kbd>: Switch between mirror mode and fractal mode. Mirror mode helps you adjust your position in the frame.

<kbd>r</kbd>: Switch between recording mode and fractal mode. The fractal parameters can be changed by moving the mouse in the sketch area. The rotation of the frame can be adjusted with the up and down keys.

<kbd>mouse click</kbd>: In recording mode, save the current parameters as a preset point. Clicking a second time with different fractal parameters will create and add a new animation between the two points.

<kbd>s</kbd>: In recording mode, save all animations to the `data/presets.json` file.
